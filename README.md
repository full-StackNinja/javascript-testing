# Javascript Testing

This repo is also a part of TOP course learning assignments. It's basic purpose is to understand the concept of javascript testing using jest.

Following function were defined and then tested successfully using jest:

- capitalize function that takes a string and returns it with the first character capitalized.

- reverseString function that takes a string and returns it reversed.

- calculator object that contains functions for the basic operations: add, subtract, divide, and multiply. Each of these functions takes two numbers and return the correct calculation.

- caesarCipher function that takes a string and a shift factor and returns it with each character “shifted”.
